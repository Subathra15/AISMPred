# AISMPred
Inflammation serves as a vital response to diverse harmful stimuli like infections, toxins, or tissue injuries, aiding in the elimination of pathogens and tissue repair. However, persistent inflammation can lead to chronic diseases. Peptide therapeutics have garnered attention for their specificity in targeting cells, yet their development remains costly and time-consuming. Therefore, small molecules -with their stability, low immunogenicity and oral bio-availability, have gained interest in predicting Anti-inflammatory Small Molecules (AISM). In this study we introduce a computational method called AISMPred, designed to classify between AISM and non-AISM. To develop computational approach for the AISMPred, we constructed a dataset comprising 1750 AISM and non-AISM, each annotated with  values sourced from PubChem BioAssay database. We computed two distinct types of molecular descriptors using PaDEL and Mordred tools. Subsequently, these descriptors were concatenated to form a hybrid feature set. The SVC-L1 regularization method is implemented for the optimum feature selection to develop robust Machine learning (ML) models. Five different conventional ML classifiers were employed such as RF, ET, KNN, LR and Ensemble method.  A total of 15 ML models were generated, among which the ET model with hybrid features achieved the highest accuracy of 92% and an AUC of 0.97 on the independent test dataset. This study provides an effective method for screening AISMs, potentially impacting drug discovery and design.
